     <li>Software licenses may or may not allow certain types of usage, contain distribution requirements or limitations, or require specific action if the software is modified. Risk is increased if the licenses of components conflict with an organization's policies. Software licenses should be documented and tracked to trace the users and use of licenses to access control information and processes according to software usage restrictions. License metadata should be recorded during the build and made available in the SBOM.</li>

Examples include using memory-safe languages and secure frameworks, isolation and sandboxing component strategies, code modularity, security features, secure-by-design components, application containers, and product features that aid in secure deployment, operation, and maintenance. Containers can be used as a strategy for tighter coupling of an application and its dependencies, immutability, and some isolation benefits. Maintain these requirements over time.</li>

     <li>As an alternative to passwords, ephemeral credentials are randomly generated, short-lived access credentials that exist only for one session to authenticate and authorize privileged connections.

     <li>Roots of trust (RoT) are highly-reliable hardware, firmware, and software components that perform specific, critical security functions, such as storing the keys used for cryptographic functions and enabling a secure boot process. Many RoT are implemented in hardware so that malware cannot tamper with the functions they provide. The RoT is established from an offline source.</li>
